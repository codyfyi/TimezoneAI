There are extreamly creative and unexpected ways the subject of **timezones** often enter a conversation. It could start with a conversation about daylight savings time and before you know it you are trying to figure out how to display someone's calendar for someone else sitting 6 timezones away. Three months of meetings later you find you that you are somehow further from a solution than when you started.

A thourghough investingation has been performed by our team of experts and the unanmasous conclusion that a generative AI is the only solution which can reliably detect all possible lines of conversation which has a significant statistical probablily of leading to the topic of **timezones** and take darastic action before  mental health harm can occur.

> If anyting related to timezones is ignored by product builders, won't significant problems go unsolved?

There are some problems which are not worth the cost and are better left unsolved.

We believe there is a brighter future for humanity without timezones.
